🧠 1. Purpose of the Simulation
The simulation’s objective is to:

Simulate the flow of traffic through a four-way intersection.

Dynamically control traffic light signals.

Represent different vehicle types—cars, buses, trucks, rickshaws, and bikes—with varying speeds and turning behavior.

Visually display the traffic movement and signal status using Pygame.

🏗️ 2. Library Imports and Initial Setup
At the top, the code imports essential libraries:

pygame handles rendering and animation.

random, math, threading, and time are used for behavior logic.

Constants are initialized for signal timings (green, yellow, red), vehicle speed, and screen setup.

It also sets up data structures to track:

Vehicle positions and directions.

Signal status for each of the four roads (right, down, left, up).

Coordinates for where vehicles should stop, move, or turn.

🚦 3. Class: TrafficSignal
The TrafficSignal class encapsulates the properties of a traffic light:

It stores timing details like red, yellow, and green durations.

Also tracks total green time used.

Multiple TrafficSignal objects are created for each direction.

🚗 4. Class: Vehicle
The Vehicle class is a pygame.sprite.Sprite subclass that represents each moving object on the road:

A vehicle knows its lane, direction, type (like car or bus), speed, and turning intent.

It loads an image of the vehicle from the images/ directory.

Vehicles manage their position and stopping point based on lane and traffic ahead.

The move() function defines how vehicles progress:

It handles straight movement or turning, including animations like rotation.

Movement also respects traffic signal status—stopping at red, and advancing at green.

🧠 5. Dynamic Signal Timing with setTime()
This function estimates how long the next green signal should last based on how many and what type of vehicles are waiting.

The formula used factors in:

Average crossing times per vehicle type.

Vehicle count in each lane.

Lane count.

This mimics intelligent traffic systems which adjust green light duration based on real-time conditions.

🔁 6. Main Simulation Loop: repeat()
This function continuously cycles through the signal lights:

Sets green, yellow, and red status with corresponding timers.

Calls setTime() when the signal is about to switch to dynamically calculate green time.

Updates vehicle stop positions between cycles.

🧾 7. Support Functions
printStatus() logs current signal statuses to the console.

updateValues() reduces the timers every second.

generateVehicles() continuously creates random vehicles at random lanes and directions.

simulationTime() tracks the total time of the simulation and calculates throughput (vehicles per second).

🖼️ 8. Class: Main – The Simulation Renderer
This class sets up the graphical window and starts all background threads:

It loads the background, signals, fonts, and vehicle images.

Handles the Pygame event loop.

Draws all vehicles and updates their positions on the screen.

Displays current signal timers and vehicles passed.

Threads are used to manage:

Signal timing (initialize)

Vehicle generation (generateVehicles)

Elapsed time tracking (simulationTime)

🎮 9. Running the Simulation
When Main() is called at the bottom of the script:

The simulation begins.

Traffic flows in all four directions with different types of vehicles.

Signal states change dynamically.

Vehicles move or turn based on signal status and their own logic.

🎤 Closing Notes
This simulation demonstrates:

Object-oriented programming with Pygame.

Multithreading in Python.

Realistic modeling of signal-based traffic behavior.

Coordination of vehicle dynamics and rendering in real time.
